                and morally ambiguous, which puts her at odds with Sailor Moon and the other

                This includes willing to let the Death Buster's victims die, if their Heart
                Crystals were the ones they were searching for, wanting to kill Hotaru, because
                she had the Messiah of Silence within her and betraying Super Sailor Saturn and
                Super Sailor Pluto in an attempt to join with Galaxia and then double-crossed
